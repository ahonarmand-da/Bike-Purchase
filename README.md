# Bike Purchase Dataset
This is a project that Alex the Analyst did but I made some tweaks.

## Process
First I watched the whole video and did everything along with Alex but then when I wanted to upload it to GitHub I thought that I want it to be something different and somehow authentic. 

So, I went to ChatGBT and asked this question:

I have a Bike Purchase dataset that consists of 1000 rows of data with these columns:
ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner(boolean), Cars, Commute distance, Region, Age, Age Brackets, Purchased bike(boolean).
Ask up to 5 professional questions to make a dashboard as a portfolio project on Excel 

Then I got this as an answer:
Here are five potential questions you could explore using the Bike Purchase dataset:

1. What is the relationship between income and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
2. How does marital status impact the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
3. What is the relationship between the number of cars owned and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
4. How does the distance of one's commute relate to the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
5. What is the relationship between education level and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
