# Bike Purchase Dataset Analysis
This is a project that Alex the Analyst did but I made some tweaks.

## Methodology
The methodology employed in this project was a combination of observational analysis and data visualization. Initially, the project followed the approach demonstrated in a video by Alex the Analyst. However, to add an element of originality and authenticity, the project was then modified through consultation with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

After giving the below instruction to the OpenAI's ChatGPT:

> I have a Bike Purchase dataset that consists of 1000 rows of data with these columns:
> ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner(boolean), Cars, Commute distance, Region, Age, Age Brackets, Purchased bike(boolean).
> Ask up to 5 professional questions to make a dashboard as a portfolio project on Excel 

Five professional questions posed buy ChatGPT:
> Here are five potential questions you could explore using the Bike Purchase dataset:
> 
> 1. What is the relationship between income and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
> 2. How does marital status impact the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
> 3. What is the relationship between the number of cars owned and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
> 4. How does the distance of one's commute relate to the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
> 5. What is the relationship between education level and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?

#### **Here are my answers for the questions:**
1. The analysis of the data reveals that the number of males who are interested in purchasing bikes is higher than that of females, although the difference between the two is not substantial. Furthermore, the relationship between gender and income indicates that male individuals with higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes, and they purchase more bikes compared to female individuals.
2. The analysis suggests that individuals who are single are more inclined towards buying bikes than those who are married. Upon reviewing the charts that represent bike purchases based on marital status, education level, number of cars owned, and gender, it can be concluded that married individuals tend to purchase fewer bikes compared to single individuals. However, there are certain specific conditions where single individuals, particularly those with a partial or high school education level, tend to purchase fewer bikes.
3. The charts indicate that individuals who either own no cars or one car are more likely to purchase bikes compared to those who own two or more cars. Despite this, married females tend to purchase more bikes compared to single females and both single and married males.
4. The charts show that individuals who reside near their workplace and have a commute distance of less than a mile are more likely to purchase bikes compared to others. The trend of purchasing bikes decreases with an increase in the commute distance, and is at its lowest for individuals who have a commute distance of ten miles or more.
5. A preliminary examination of the chart reveals that individuals with bachelor's or graduate degrees are more willing to purchase bikes. Nevertheless, this observation changes when considering married individuals, who seem to prefer alternative modes of transportation.

## Findings
The analysis revealed that males are more likely to purchase bikes than females, with the likelihood of purchasing a bike increasing with higher income for males. Single individuals were also found to be more likely to purchase bikes than married individuals. The likelihood of purchasing a bike was found to be higher for individuals who own no or one car and for those with a short commute distance. Finally, the analysis showed that individuals with a bachelor's or graduate degree are more likely to purchase bikes.

## Conclusion
This project has provided insights into the factors that influence the likelihood of purchasing a bike. It serves as a valuable reference for individuals interested in exploring the relationship between various demographic and economic factors and consumer behavior. The project is a first portfolio project for the author, who aims to continue to improve their skills in data analysis and visualization through further studies and projects. Feedback is welcome and appreciated to help guide further improvement.
